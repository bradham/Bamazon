# Bamazon
A simple ordering system similar to Amazon

Ordering items using a database.

When Bamazon starts it will first display all of the items available for sale.

It will then ask you the ID of the product they would like to buy from the items available.
Then how many units of the product you would like to buy.

Enter those numbers and your final purchasing total will be shown if we have the number of items you want.

(run it by typing 

node bamazonCustomer.js

in the command prompt.)
